# `@chesscom/design-system`

> Shared Vue components

## Storybook

All Components in this package can be found in our [Storybook collection](https://design-system.devchess.com/). _Legacy Components are not included in this package._

### Install

```bash
npm install @chesscom/design-system
```

**index.ts**
```ts
// Load styles into your application
import '@chesscom/design-system/dist/style.css';
```

**Important Note**
<br/>To keep this package lightweight, `vue` does not come bundled in this package. It is expected that `vue` is installed and made available in the consuming application that uses this package.

### Usage

Find the Component you want, and `import` it. All Components are prefixed with `Cc` (i.e. `CcButton`).

**App.vue**
```vue
<template>
  <CcButton/>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
// Load Component
import { CcButton } from '@chesscom/design-system';
</script>
```
